# Faster Video

[AMO Link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/faster-video/)

Addon for Firefox for Desktop that allows one to manipulate the playback rate of HTML5 audio and videos.
While right-clicking on a video or audio element allows one to change the playback rate to either 1.5X or 2.0X, this
addon gives more control.
This is a counterpart to Faster Video Mobile that is available for Firefox for Android.

Requires Firefox for Desktop 38.0+

If a HTML5 audio or video is playing, change the playback rate from the context menu by selecting video speed. You can access the context menu
by right-clicking anywhere on the screen except the video itself.
The menu will only be present if a single video is playing.

##Customizing Speeds
The default video speeds and video speed modifiers can be changed through changing the preferences. The numbers should be comma-separated.
