# Faster Video

Addon for Firefox for Desktop that allows one to manipulate the playback rate of HTML5 videos.
While right-clicking on the video allows one to change the playback rate to either 1.5X or 2.0X, this
addon gives more control.
This is a counterpart to Faster Video Mobile that is available for Firefox for Android.

Requires Firefox for Desktop 20.0+

If a HTML5 video is playing, change the playback rate from the context menu by selecting video speed. You can access the context menu
by right-clicking anywhere on the screen except the video itself.
The menu will only be present if a single video is playing.
